The license for this project is the Apache 2.0 license, open source with a free community version and a paid premium version.

The community version is free for non-commercial use only under a Restrict Apache 2.0, non-commercial use only License, discussed at: https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7400/restrict-apache-2-0-to-non-commercial-use-only.

As a permissive license, the Apache 2.0 license does not prevent extra restrictions. My code may be used in any project as long as the attribution requirements are met. Commercial projects would not be licensed under this restricted Apache license. Commercial use is NOT LICENSED. Non profit organizations can of course make whatever legal use they like of my code published here in this project, hardInfo, provided credit is given to its sole author, me: George Keith Watson. My email: keith.michael.collins@gmx.com.

Since I am looking for co-developers of this as a commercial product, I will require a non-competition agreement and a trade-secret agreement.
