The purpose of this project is to create a Python API for gethering personal computer hardware information and other platform information into usable objects insode a Python program.  The general method it employs is to safely run Linux commands from within Python and then parse the output.

Writing Python programs to run on any operating system on any hardware is not possible without being able to dynamically adapt to the stack of layers running beneath your program.  Although Python's library is very helpful in this regard, there are still problems adapting various functional categories of features, such as those required for security and forensic progamming, so that the result is as general as possible.  This project aims to solve that by collecting anything and everything relevant, thereby also providing a general interface to Linux commands usable in any Python program.

An interesting possible spin-off once all the hardware and other low level components are represented by objects is to implement the behavior of each as stated in their standaards using methods defined in their respective classes, and then to run the component system in real time in parallel with the actual computer hardware and software stack by receiving real-time event messages from it.  The system state can then be compared to the model state to detect any malfunctions or malware produced anomalies.
