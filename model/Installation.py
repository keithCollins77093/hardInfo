#   Module:         model/Installation.py
#   Date Started:   March 20, 2022
#   Purpose:        Store installation location and other local details.
#   Development:
#       To run this program locally having decompressed the source archive without errors,
#       certain constants in this file must be changed.
#           INSTALLATION_FOLDER must be the folder that hardInfo.py is located in.  This will be the root
#                               of the source tree.
